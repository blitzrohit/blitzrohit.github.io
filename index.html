    <h1 style="text-align:right">The Convergence</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify">The title of this website says Convergence, but it has everything to do with its opposite, Divergence.
       Human civilization couldn't have reached the state it is in but for divergence in thought, or Divergent Thinking,
       which is the ability of a human being to explore newer ways and answers first to the basic challenges of life, and consquently
       to more and more complex and abstract problems. Although we are too far away and too insignificant in the Grand scheme of things,
       just achieving a state of consciousness to realize this separates us from the rest of the species.
       The human progress is a result of two separate processes, a rarer Divergent Thinking which leads to newer avenues,and a much
       prevalent Convergent Thinking, which enables the execution of the avenues obtained from Divergent Thinking in a scale which can reach 
       the masses. All primary learning is training in Convergent Thinking, with a focus on application rather than finding new solutions.
       The real creation of value is the First Convergence of ideas developed fron Divergent Thinking, to a point where they start being 
       obvious to the masses. This website is an attempt on my part to share my ideas to interested or relevant people so that they can evaluate 
       them and together reach The Convergence.</p><br><br><br><br<br>
